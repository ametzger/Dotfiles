# dotfiles

My hand-stolen, hacked-together dotfiles accumulated over many years. 

Used in combination with [MikeMcQuaid/strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap)
 and [ametzger/homebrew-brewfile](https://github.com/ametzger/homebrew-brewfile) 
you too can have a MacBook or Windows machine setup just the way I like it.

## MacOS install

To install on MacOS, clone this repo and run `bin/setup` to setup basic CLI
tools (zsh, git, etc). There are various scripts in the `bin` subdirectory
to configure various tools I have used at one time or another.

## Windows install

For Windows I only really have bits and pieces of the customizations I have made 
repeatedly over the years, not a reproducible setup like I do for MacOS. Some good 
places to start are [choco-packages-work.ps1](https://github.com/ametzger/dotfiles/blob/master/winders/choco-packages-work.ps1) 
and [init-powershell.ps1](https://github.com/ametzger/dotfiles/blob/master/winders/init-powershell.ps1). There are other
assorted bits and bobs in the [winders subdirectory](https://github.com/ametzger/dotfiles/tree/master/winders) of the repo.
